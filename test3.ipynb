This work enhances noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models, focusing on perceptually relevant scales, leading to superior performance in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. A novel transformer-based architecture is presented for this purpose, featuring separate weights for image and text modalities to enable a bidirectional information flow, thus improving text comprehension and aesthetics in generated images. The study shows that this approach follows predictable scaling trends, correlating lower validation loss with better synthesis quality, outperforming state-of-the-art models.
